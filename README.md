# D-Project

**D-Project** is a Digimon Project built with **RPG Maker XP &amp; Pokemon Essentials**. It aims to deliver an unique experience for the Digimon Community. Since long fans have been waiting a good game that captures the abundance of the Digimon's World from Bandai. It's my opinion that they have failed over these past years. Sure enough, a lot of projects similar to this one have been started on the internet, but I'm hoping to make things different this time. 

# Team

This project was started by me, [Tiago Simões](http://github.com/tloriato), a full-time student with enthusiasm about games and fan of the Digimon Series. However, I'm not alone. Those are the people assisting me:

1. **Matheus Homsi**: My cousin, who introduced me into the Digital World while we were still very young and whom I'm greatful for having with me. He'll help me through the story and probably handle the Sound Design of the whole game.
2. [**Victor Maia**](http://github.com/maiavictor): A great friend and a full-stack developer with enthusiasm on pure functional programming languages, and ex competitive ~~Pokémon~~ player. Will help me with the more technical side of the project and with his valuable opinion.
3. **Gabriel Medeiros**: Close friend who will assist me with his thoughts about the game and the Quality Assurance of it, by playing it ~~hundreds of time~~.
4. **Pedro Enrique**: College friend who will probably handle the Design outside of the game aspect.

# Features

There is nothing yet other than the idea and the motivation.  Nothing is defined and I have no idea what will come out of it, you are very encouraged to influence the process with your own ideas and contributions [although I would like to hear first because of the nature of the project*]!

*RPG Maker XP doesn't handle multi-user colaboration very well.

Even so, we **do** have a few things in mind:
Gameplay Features:

- Kanto will be remapped into the Digital World and **routes** will probably be changed to a tech-reference. Probably **Hexadecimal Identification**.
- Tamers (Trainers) will have a higher difficulty than Firered and will retain a **six Digimon limit** as opposed to Digimon's usual one.
- The Pokeball mechanic will be replaced with a single **Digivice** that holds the **"data" of each Digimon**.
- **All Pokemon will be replaced with Digimon** (the number of available Digimon is tentative)
    - Trying to decide between a smaller number for the sake of simplicity, an equal number to available Pokemon in Firered, or a full 386.
- **New Moves and Types** in the Game, following the Digimon Series.
    - A more balanced stat range for all Digimon to boost the difficulty.
- Pokedex to be replaced with **Digivice**, which may or may not be complete with all relevant info at the beginning (to be discussed).
- **Full Digivolution System**, faithful to the Series and Games.
    - Slime, In-Training, Rookie, Champion, Ultimate &amp; Mega will be available
    - **Multiple possibilities of evolution** from a single Digimon, based on a series of factors.
- **Animated Battle System**: 
    - Customized but faithful to the Pokemon Style. 
    - This will be provided by the [Elite Battle System](www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=343665).
- "Digimon Daycare" will produce Digieggs, if possible.
- Possible **"Fossil Digimon"**.

# Story

We already have the core story of the game, but we are in the process of tying all together nicely. Will update this when it's done.

# Roadmap

As I'm and all others involved are students, we have a limited amount of time to work on this project. Because of that it's not possible to give a real estimate of anything right now, but I'll trace a few points that I see as important in the short/medium run:

- Insertion of all Digimon Sprites on the Battle System
- Completing all initial stats of the 100's of Digimons
- Wraping up the Story
- Creation of the first few maps
